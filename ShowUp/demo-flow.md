# 🚀 ShowUp MVP Demo - Using Existing Contracts

## Current Status ✅
- **ShowUpEvents** deployed: `0xa19273383554e1e1`
- **ShowUpStaking** deployed: `0xa19273383554e1e1` 
- **Stake Vault** created for main account
- **App running** at: http://localhost:3000

## 🎯 Simple MVP Demo Flow

### Phase 1: Test Core Functionality
1. **Create Events** via ShowUpEvents contract
2. **Stake Management** via ShowUpStaking contract  
3. **Frontend Integration** with existing web app
4. **Revenue Collection** (forfeited stakes → you)

### Phase 2: Key Features to Test
- ✅ User registration with username
- ✅ Stake deposit (holds user's money)
- ✅ Event check-in system
- ✅ Automatic stake return for attendees
- ✅ Revenue from no-shows

## 💡 Revenue Model (Simplified)
```
User Stakes 1 FLOW → Event Happens → Two Outcomes:
├── ✅ Shows Up: Gets 1 FLOW back
└── ❌ No Show: You keep the 1 FLOW (revenue!)
```

## 🔧 Next Steps
1. Test the existing contracts with simple transactions
2. Build minimal frontend components
3. Create batch processing for multiple users
4. Scale gradually based on usage

This approach is:
- ✅ **Lower Risk**: Uses proven deployed contracts
- ✅ **Faster MVP**: No complex new deployments
- ✅ **Real Revenue**: Actual money from no-shows
- ✅ **Scalable**: Can enhance over time
